	* Reworked a lot of the code so it handles packets, acks, naks,
          control-C etc. in a coherent way. This reduces the number of ways
          the remote GDB protocol can screw-up, but cannot really fix it.
	  Made a skeleton target module from which people can work in
	  building real ones. Made a real target module for the MSP430, 
          but that is not open source. Added support for some missing GDB
          remote protocol features, which current GDBs may not even use
          (e.g. read a single register), and fixed some others that did
          not work (e.g. CRC32 a memory block). Renamed the program from
          rproxy to gdbproxy - there are several things called rproxy,
          such as a program in the rsync package, and rproxy is not very
          descriptive.
