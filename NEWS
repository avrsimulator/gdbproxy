Changes in gdbproxy 0.7.2:

* Add support for qThreadExtraInfo, qfThreadInfo, and qsThreadInfo commands.

* Add support for qSupported commands.

Changes in gdbproxy 0.7.1:

* Reworked a lot of the code. Added a skeleton target program, that should
  be easy to adapt for real targets. Added support for the TI MSP430,
  although that module is not open source. Dropped support for the ppcdbm
  module, as I have never seen one, and cannot support it (anyone that wants
  to put it back is welcome to). Added support for some bits of the GDB
  remote protocol not previously supported - they may not actually be used
  by any current version of GDB, but thoroughness never hurt anyone, did it?i
  (actually, yes it did!) Changed the name to gdbproxy, as several
  other programs have the name rproxy, and rproxy isn't very descriptive
  anyway. VC++ support has been dropped, and the software builds properly
  using the ./configure make approach under Cygwin and MinGW32.

  The software has been tested on RedHat Linux 7.2 and 7.3, and using
  Cygwin and MinGW32 on WinME and WinXP.

  As with all good version numbers, a tiny increment represents a large
  change! :-)
